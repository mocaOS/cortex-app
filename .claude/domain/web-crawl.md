# MDHarvest powered by Crawl4ai (web → markdown)

The "Web Import" feature: harvest URLs into clean markdown and ingest them as normal documents (chunk → embed → entity/relationship extraction → KG). It supersedes the standalone, now-deprecated `mdharvest` tool. Gated by `ENABLE_WEB_CRAWL` + `CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` (see [`environment.md`](../environment.md)).

**Core principle:** cortex-app never embeds a browser/crawler stack. It speaks [crawl4ai](https://github.com/unclecode/crawl4ai)'s native REST API over HTTP. One code path, two deployments — only env differs:

- **self-host** — `CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` → the user's own crawl4ai (`:11235`). They own their data.
- **cloud (AaaS)** — `CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` → the shared per-host crawl4ai (one container per server, many tenant stacks), set by the operator in env the customer never sees. Hosted in the `cortex-helper` repo's compose.

Empty URL ⇒ feature off. There is **no** in-process fallback — that ~4 GB browser stack is exactly the per-tenant footprint the shared-service model exists to avoid.

## Client (`services/crawl_client.py`)

Mirrors `helper_client.py`'s transport discipline: one shared `httpx.AsyncClient`, 3 retries with backoff+jitter on transient failures, and its own `CircuitBreaker("crawl")` (reused from `helper_client`; surfaced as op `crawl` in `/metrics`). Auth: `Authorization: Bearer <CRAWL_SERVICE_TOKEN>` when set (crawl4ai's scheme — NOT the helper's `X-Helper-Token`); also sends `X-Tenant-ID` + `X-Request-ID`. The token is effectively mandatory for crawl4ai ≥ 0.9.0 — tokenless, crawl4ai binds its API to `127.0.0.1` only and is unreachable cross-container. `main.py`'s lifespan logs a WARN when `ENABLE_WEB_CRAWL` + `CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` are set but `CRAWL_SERVICE_TOKEN` is empty.

- **`crawl_markdown(url, content_filter=None, query=None)`** → POST `/md` with `{url, f, c:"0"}` (+ `q` for bm25). `f` defaults to `CRAWL_CONTENT_FILTER` (`fit`). Returns `{url, title, markdown}`. Title is best-effort: first `# ` H1 in the markdown, else derived from the URL path. Raises `CrawlUnavailableError` on circuit-open / network / 4xx / empty markdown. `c="0"` = cache-bypass (defense-in-depth; see Privacy).
- **`discover_links(url)`** → POST `/crawl` with `{urls:[url]}`, reads `results[0].links.internal`. Filters to **same-host** http(s) links, drops `_SKIP_PATTERNS` (login/cart/legal/…) and asset extensions, dedups, caps at `CRAWL_DISCOVER_MAX_LINKS`. Returns `{source_url, domain, links:[{url,title}]}`.

4xx is the caller's problem (bad URL/auth) and does NOT trip the breaker; transient 5xx/timeouts do.

## Endpoints (`main.py`)

`_require_web_crawl_enabled()` 404s unless `ENABLE_WEB_CRAWL` and `CRAWL_SERVICE_URL` are both set. Both endpoints require `manage` permission.

- **`POST /api/web-import`** `{urls[], collection_id?, content_filter?, query?}` → validates http(s) + dedups, rejects > `CRAWL_MAX_URLS_PER_JOB` (400) and the graph file-limit (403), then spawns `_run_web_import_task` and returns `WebImportResponse{task_id, accepted_urls, message}` immediately. Poll `GET /api/tasks/{task_id}`.
- **`POST /api/web-import/discover`** `{url}` → synchronous `discover_links`; 502 on crawl failure. Returns `WebDiscoverResponse{source_url, domain, links[]}`.

**`_run_web_import_task`** (crawl → aggregate-per-domain → stage-then-hand-off):
1. Crawl all URLs concurrently (`asyncio.Semaphore(CRAWL_CONCURRENCY)`), collecting each page's `{url, title, markdown, netloc}`. Per-URL failures are collected, not fatal. All-fail ⇒ `fail_task`.
2. **Aggregate by domain.** All pages of one domain become **one** markdown document (dict keeps first-seen domain order; pages sorted homepage-first), **titled and filed by the domain** (`# nurecas.com`, `nurecas.com.md`) — never a page title, since crawl4ai often falls back to the URL path for a title (e.g. `o.html`), which would make the filename and every citation read as a random page. A single-page domain keeps the plain per-page header (`_format_crawl_markdown`, H1 = domain); a multi-page domain becomes a sectioned site document (`_format_crawl_site_markdown` — a domain H1 + one `## {title}` + `> Source:` section per page). This is deliberate: a site's subpages read as **one related work**, so the retrieval + KG pipeline can tie an artist named only on the About page to their practice/exhibitions/press pages that never repeat the name. Each aggregated doc is written to `{custom_inputs_dir}/{uuid}.md` and `store_file_only(source=f"crawl:{domain}")` (staged PENDING, attached to the collection). A domain whose staging throws moves its pages to `failures`; if nothing stages ⇒ `fail_task`.
3. The import task **completes immediately** — `complete_task` with `{imported (pages), documents (per-domain docs created), failed, total, succeeded[], failures[], processing:{task_id, status:"queued"}}` — so the modal's "Import complete" popup fires the moment the documents are *added*. The shared extract/embed/KG pass is handed to a **separate `batch_processing` task** (`create_task("batch_processing") + _spawn_chain_task(_run_batch_processing_task(...))`, the same task the process-pending endpoint spawns) so processing is watchable/resumable on the Documents page instead of blocking the import. If spawning that task somehow fails, staging still stands (docs sit PENDING, processable from the Documents page) and the import is not failed for it.

**Markdown provenance header** (`_format_crawl_markdown`):

```markdown
# {title}

> Source: {url}
> Extracted: {YYYY-MM-DD}

---

{crawl4ai markdown}
```

The `.md` extension routes through `document_processor`'s `RAW_TEXT_EXTENSIONS` fast path — no Docling, markdown passes through verbatim (see [`document-pipeline.md`](document-pipeline.md)).

## Privacy (multi-tenant cloud) — no cross-customer leakage

A hard requirement, satisfied by construction. The controls live where the operator owns them (the shared crawl4ai config + this client), not in tenant trust:

1. **No persistent volume** on the crawl4ai container → cache/results are ephemeral, gone on restart, never browsable.
2. **Sync endpoints only** (`/md`, `/crawl`) — never the async `/crawl/job/{id}` API whose results live (TTL'd) in Redis and are addressable by id. The shared deployment runs no Redis.
3. **Cache-bypass per request** (`c="0"`) so one tenant is never served another's cached page.
4. **Network isolation + token** — crawl4ai binds a private interface, firewalled off the public net; `CRAWL_SERVICE_TOKEN` ↔ crawl4ai `CRAWL4AI_API_TOKEN` (`security.api_token`). For crawl4ai ≥ 0.9.0 the token is required (tokenless it binds `127.0.0.1` only).

There is no crawl-history surface to leak; 1–3 make cross-tenant visibility impossible, 4 controls who can call it. **SSRF**: crawl4ai fetches any URL given — on shared hosts, add egress rules blocking RFC1918 + `169.254.169.254` at the network layer (see `cortex-helper/README.md`).

## Frontend (Documents-page modal)

The entry point is a split **Upload** button on the Documents page (`components/DocumentList.tsx`): a `▾` dropdown beside Upload offers a single **Web Import** item that opens `components/documents/WebImportModal.tsx` (collection → URLs → Discover links → content filter → "Import from Web" → live progress → completion screen; refreshes the doc list via `onImported`).

Gating: `DocumentList` calls `/api/features` (read-permission, non-admin) which returns `enable_web_crawl` (already AND-ed with "crawl service configured") and renders the `▾`/modal only when true; the full `/api/admin/config` (`SystemConfigResponse.enable_web_crawl`) is admin-only. The modal reuses `api.webImport` / `api.webDiscover` / `api.pollTask`. (There is no `/add`-page entry point — that approach was dropped.)

## Design notes (why cortex-app stays thin)

- **crawl4ai does all the heavy lifting** — JS rendering via a headless browser pool, anti-scrape handling, and HTML→markdown content filtering (`fit` = readability extraction). cortex-app carries no browser, HTML parser, or scraping dependency of its own — just an HTTP client (`crawl_client.py`).
- **No crawl-specific storage** — jobs reuse the existing `TaskProgress` tracker and land as ordinary `Document` nodes; there is no separate crawl database or history table.
- The only crawl-specific logic in cortex-app is the same-host link/skip-pattern filtering (`crawl_client.py`) and the provenance header (`_format_crawl_markdown`).

## Future (not built — MVP is batch import + discovery)

A recurring **crawl connector** (saved sources, scheduled re-crawl, content-hash dedup, `crawl_*` provenance on `Document`) would mirror the git connector; a researcher-agent `web_crawl` tool would mirror `git_repo`. Both are deferred.
